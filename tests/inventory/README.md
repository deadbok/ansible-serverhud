# Inventory

Host are defined and grouped in `hosts`, the directories `group_vars` and
`host_vars` contains variable definitions for specific groups and hosts.

## Hosts and groups

### Groups

    * *monitor*: Every host that should act as a monitoring server.
    * *clients*: Every host not a monitoring server.
    * *vagrant*: Every host that has been created by vagrant.
    * *snmp*: Every host that uses SNMP (including the monitoring server)
    * *snmpd*: Every host that is supposed to run SNMPd for communicating
      with the monitoring server.

### Hosts

 * *monitor-vm*: Monitoring server.
 * *dummy-vm*: Unused example machine.
 * *dummier-vm*: Unused example machine.
 * *desktop-vm*: Desktop machine to access the monitoring server.

## Group variables

 * *monitor*: Variables for the monitoring server.
     * Set IP addresses for externally accessible services.
     * Set network on which LibreNMS does autodiscovery.
 * *snmp*: Variables for SNMP used by both clients and the monitoring server.
     * Set SNMP community string.
     * Set SNMP admin user info and location.
 * *vagrant*: Variables for all Vagrant VMs.
     * Set up SSH connection details for Vagrant VMs.
 * *all.yml*: Variables that applies to all groups.
     * Set the IP address of the monitoring VM.

## Host variables

For illustrative purposes this example does not use Vagrant to provision the
VMs using Ansible. This is to make the example act more like a situation where
the machines were created by other means.
